Synapse reads your entire GitHub codebase and answers natural-language questions about it, generates AI summaries of commits, transcribes team meetings, and lets you ask questions about what was discussed — all powered by a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline so answers stay grounded in your actual code and conversations, not generic guesses.

## 🤖 Overview

Synapse takes the guesswork out of understanding a new codebase or catching up on a meeting you missed. Instead of manually digging through files or replaying recordings, it lets you just *ask*.

- **Link a Repo** — connect any GitHub repository and Synapse clones it, reads every file, and builds a searchable knowledge base of the code
- **Codebase Q&A** — ask plain-English questions like *"which file handles authentication?"* and get an answer grounded in the actual source
- **Commit Summaries** — poll recent commits and get AI-generated, plain-English summaries of what changed and why
- **Meeting Transcription** — upload a recording and Synapse transcribes it, extracts chapters, and makes it fully searchable
- **Meeting Q&A** — ask questions about anything discussed in a past meeting and get an answer with the relevant snippet as context

Built with **Next.js** on the frontend and **FastAPI (Python)** on the backend, with **AssemblyAI** for transcription, **Sentence-Transformers** for embeddings, **Pinecone** for vector search, and **Groq / Cohere** powering answer generation.

## 🔋 Key Features

### 🔍 Codebase Intelligence
- **Repo Linking** — connect a GitHub repository by URL; Synapse clones it and indexes the code
- **Natural-Language Q&A** — ask questions about structure, logic, or specific files
- **Automatic Documentation** — AI-generated summaries of source files for faster onboarding

### 📝 Commit Insights
- **Poll Commits** — pull recent commits from the linked repo
- **AI Summaries** — plain-English explanation of each commit's changes, generated from the diff

### 🎙️ Meeting Intelligence
- **Upload & Transcribe** — drop in an audio file, get a full transcript with auto-generated chapters (title, timestamp range, gist, headline, summary)
- **Ask Follow-Up Questions** — query anything said in the meeting and get an answer grounded in the transcript
- **Per-Meeting Namespaces** — each meeting's embeddings are isolated so answers never mix context across meetings

### 👥 Team Collaboration
- **Multi-Project Support** — manage several linked repos/projects from one dashboard
- **Invite Team Members** — bring collaborators into a project
- **Avatars & Activity** — see who's on a project and recent commit activity at a glance

## 🧠 How the AI Pipeline Works

```
Audio file uploaded
      │
      ▼
Stored in Supabase → URL passed to backend
      │
      ▼
AssemblyAI transcribes audio → chapters extracted
      │
      ▼
Transcript split into ~800-char chunks (130-char overlap)
      │
      ▼
Each chunk embedded in parallel (Sentence-Transformers, 384-dim)
      │
      ▼
Chunks + embeddings upserted into Pinecone (per-meeting namespace)
      │
      ▼
User asks a question
      │
      ├─ Question embedded
      ├─ Top-k similar chunks retrieved from Pinecone
      └─ Chunks passed as context to LLM (Groq/Cohere)
      │
      ▼
Grounded answer returned to user
```

The same retrieve → augment → generate pattern powers codebase Q&A: the repo's files replace the meeting transcript as the source content that gets chunked, embedded, and searched.

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **Separate Frontend/Backend Services** — Next.js client talks to a standalone FastAPI service over HTTP; each can be deployed and scaled independently
- **Async-First Backend** — FastAPI routes use `async`/`await` throughout, with `asyncio.gather` to generate embeddings for multiple chunks concurrently instead of sequentially
- **Local Embeddings, No Per-Query API Cost** — embeddings run on-device via Sentence-Transformers rather than a paid API, since the chosen LLM provider (Groq) doesn't offer an embeddings endpoint
- **Per-Namespace Vector Isolation** — each meeting gets its own Pinecone namespace so retrieval never leaks context between unrelated meetings
- **Type-Safe API Layer** — tRPC gives end-to-end TypeScript types between frontend and the Node-side API layer, catching mismatches at compile time
